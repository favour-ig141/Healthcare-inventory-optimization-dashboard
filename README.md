# Healthcare Inventory Optimization Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project analyzes inventory performance for a pharmaceutical organization, focusing on stock movement, expiry risk, and overall inventory health. The goal is to transform raw inventory data into actionable insights to support data-driven decision-making.

---

## Business Problem
Pharmaceutical companies face challenges such as:
- Expiry-related financial losses
- Dead stock tying up capital
- Uneven stock distribution across branches
- Inconsistent consumption patterns

This dashboard provides visibility into inventory performance, enabling strategic decisions that optimize stock levels and improve operational efficiency.

---

## Objectives
- Monitor stock-in, stock-out, and stock balance
- Identify high-risk expiring products
- Evaluate dead stock value
- Compare performance across branches or locations
- Track consumption trends through the year
- Categorize inventory by expiry risk (Safe, Near Expiry, Critical)

---

## Tools & Techniques
- Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Charts, Dashboard)
- KPI design & visualization
- Expiry risk categorization
- Ratio & trend analysis

---

## Key Insights
- Highest expiry risk product: **Panadol (~$5.8K)**  
- Dead stock with highest monetary impact: **Augmentin (~$24K)**  
- Main branch accounts for **~55% of total dispensed stock**  
- Peak consumption observed in **January (~12%)**  
- Year-end stock movement spikes highlight seasonal demand  

These insights highlight potential revenue leakage, overstocking, and distribution inefficiencies.

---

## Recommendations
- Set reorder thresholds based on consumption trends
- Redistribute near-expiry products to high-performing branches
- Apply discounting strategies for critical expiry stock
- Reduce procurement for consistently low-turnover products
- Introduce automated alerts for expiring inventory

---

## Business Impact
- Reduced financial loss due to expiry
- Improved cash flow management
- Better stock allocation across locations
- Enhanced operational decision-making
